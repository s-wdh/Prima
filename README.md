### Description for the users on how to interact
Use A and D or left- and right-arrow keys to walk and the space key to jump, while moving the Character "Pingu" through the Track. 
The Goal of the game is to bring Pingu back home safely before the time runs out. 
On the way you need to collect three stars, so Pingu is able to get home.
Additionally, you can collect coins for Pingu.
